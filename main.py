#The GET Method - GET is used to request data from a specified resource. When you access a websiteâ€™s 
#page, your browser makes a get request to your API and your API is returning the front-end that is 
#displayed in the browser

#The POST Method - POST is used to send data to the server to create/update a resource

#The PUT Method - PUT is used to send data to a server to create / update a resource. The basic 
#difference between PUT and POST is that a POST request is when you can create multiple copies of the 
#same resource

#The DELETE Method - DELETE is used to delete a resource. The default method used by flask is GET.
